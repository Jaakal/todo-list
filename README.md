# Todo List

Project, where you can add todos and group them into different projects. From the left select-box you can choose which group todos you would like to see. To add a new group, you will first have to press the `Add Group` button and the form for doing that will be displayed and then you can add a new activity to that group pressing the `Add Activity` button. To add a new todo, you'll have to press the `Add Activity` button and the form for doing that will be displayed. In order to edit the todo, correct some typo or change the status later on, you'll have to press the `Edit` button on the corresponding todo, and the form will be displayed, which is filled with the current todo values. For deleting the todo, you'll have to press the `Delete` button of the corresponding todo. In every initial load or refresh of the page, all the empty groups are removed from the group list.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into your local computer.

### Installing

First you'll have to install the newest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Otherwise the npx command could not be available. Then move into the project main directory on the console and follow the instructions below. 

Install all packages:

```
$ npm install
```

Run Webpack:

```
$ npx webpack
```

Now open the `index.html` in the browser.


You can instruct webpack to "watch" all files within your dependency graph for changes. If one of these files is updated, the code will be recompiled so you don't have to run the full build manually:

```
$ npx webpack --watch
```

### webpack.config.js

The main file of which the bundle is created is set in the entry:

```
entry: './src/javascript/index.js'
```

The output file of the JavaScript bundle and its name is set in the output:

```
output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'main.js'
  },
```

The output file name of the CSS bundle is set in the plugins:

```
plugins: [
  
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "main.css"
    })
  
  ]
```

### Notice about production mode and postcss.config.js

In postcss.config.js there is a check for **process.env.NODE_ENV** variable. The thing is even if you set Webpack mode to production in `webpack.config.js` it won't automatically change Node environment variable.

The simplest way to configure this is to install cross-env package:

```
$ npm install --save-dev cross-env
```

Now when you run `npx cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config webpack.config.js` the process.env.NODE_ENV variable will be production and postcss.config.js check is going to work:

```
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    module.exports = {
        plugins: [
            require('autoprefixer'),
            require('cssnano')
        ]
    }
}
```

[From Webpack documentation:](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) Technically, NODE_ENV is a system environment variable that Node.js exposes into running scripts. It is used by convention to determine dev-vs-prod behavior by server tools, build scripts, and client-side libraries. Contrary to expectations, process.env.NODE_ENV **is not set to "production"** within the build script webpack.config.js. Thus, conditionals like `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '[name].[hash].bundle.js' : '[name].bundle.js'` within webpack configurations do not work as expected.
